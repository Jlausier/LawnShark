## Description

An app to connect customers in need of yard work (Mowing, tree trimming, pressure washing, etc.) with companies that provide those services. Customers post the jobs they need completed along with how much they are willing to pay. Companies can then see the job postings and place bids. When a customer accepts a company's bid the company will be notified.
